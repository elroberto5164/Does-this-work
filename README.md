# does-this-work
I'm looking for feedback on this python code. The program is a simple employee management program using mysql connector and I am wanting feedback on if there is an easier way to code this, and for readability. 
Also if you have any ideas on what I should add to this program please tell me. Don't tell me how to code them, just the concept like for example "I think a modify employee function would be a nice touch" or something like that. I'm trying to learn more about python and mysql in doing this. 
Thank you for reading this and looking at my code!!! I am fresh out of college and new to this entire concept, so any and all feedback is absolutely welcome!
